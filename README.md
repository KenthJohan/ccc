### Tools
* http://www.msys2.org/<br>
At its core is an independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software. It provides a bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.
It features a package management system to provide easy installation of packages, Pacman. It brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward package building.


### Libs
* https://github.com/nanomsg/nng<br>
NNG, like its predecessors nanomsg (and to some extent ZeroMQ), is a lightweight, broker-less library, offering a simple API to solve common recurring messaging problems, such as publish/subscribe, RPC-style request/reply, or service discovery. The API frees the programmer from worrying about details like connection management, retries, and other common considerations, so that they can focus on the application instead of the plumbing.
NNG is implemented in C, requiring only C99 and CMake to build. It can be built as a shared or a static library, and is readily embeddable. It is also designed to be easy to port to new platforms if your platform is not already supported.
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/<br>
IUP is a portable toolkit for building graphical user interfaces. It offers a configuration API in three basic languages: C, Lua and LED. IUP purpose is to allow a program to be executed in different systems without any modification.
* https://sigrok.org/wiki/Libserialport<br>
libserialport (sometimes abbreviated as "sp") is a minimal, cross-platform shared library written in C that is intended to take care of the OS-specific details when writing software that uses serial ports.
